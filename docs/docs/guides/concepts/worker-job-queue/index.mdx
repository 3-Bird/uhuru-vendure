The Vendure Worker is a Node.js process responsible for running computationally intensive
or otherwise long-running tasks in the background. For example, updating a
search index or sending emails. Running such tasks in the background allows
the server to stay responsive, since a response can be returned immediately
without waiting for the slower tasks to complete.

Put another way, the Worker executes **jobs** which have been placed in the **job queue**.

![Worker & Job Queue](./worker-job-queue.webp)

## The worker

The worker is started by calling the [`bootstrapWorker()`](/reference/typescript-api/worker/bootstrap-worker/) function with the same
configuration as is passed to the main server `bootstrap()`. In a standard Vendure installation, this is found
in the `index-worker.ts` file:

```ts title="src/index-worker.ts"
import { bootstrapWorker } from '@vendure/core';
import { config } from './vendure-config';

bootstrapWorker(config)
    .then(worker => worker.startJobQueue())
    .catch(err => {
        console.log(err);
    });
```

### Underlying architecture

The Worker is a NestJS standalone application. This means it is almost identical to the main server app,
but does not have any network layer listening for requests. The server communicates with the worker
via a “job queue” architecture. The exact implementation of the job queue is dependent on the
configured [`JobQueueStrategy`](/reference/typescript-api/job-queue/job-queue-strategy/), but by default
the worker polls the database for new jobs.

### Multiple workers

It is possible to run multiple workers in parallel to better handle heavy loads. Using the
[`JobQueueOptions.activeQueues`](/reference/typescript-api/job-queue/job-queue-options#activequeues) configuration, it is even possible to have particular workers dedicated
to one or more specific types of jobs. For example, if your application does video transcoding,
you might want to set up a dedicated worker just for that task:

```ts title="src/transcoder-worker.ts"
import { bootstrapWorker, mergeConfig } from '@vendure/core';
import { config } from './vendure-config';

const transcoderConfig = mergeConfig(config, {
    jobQueueOptions: {
      activeQueues: ['transcode-video'],
    }
});

bootstrapWorker(transcoderConfig)
  .then(worker => worker.startJobQueue())
  .catch(err => {
    console.log(err);
  });
```

### Running jobs on the main process

It is possible to run jobs from the Job Queue on the main server. This is mainly used for testing
and automated tasks, and is not advised for production use, since it negates the benefits of
running long tasks off of the main process. To do so, you need to manually start the JobQueueService:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { bootstrap, JobQueueService } from '@vendure/core';
import { config } from './vendure-config';

bootstrap(config)
    .then(app => app.get(JobQueueService).start())
    .catch(err => {
        console.log(err);
        process.exit(1);
    });
```

### ProcessContext

Sometimes your code may need to be aware of whether it is being run as part of a server or worker process.
In this case you can inject the [`ProcessContext`](/reference/typescript-api/common/process-context/) provider and query it like this:

```ts title="src/plugins/my-plugin/services/my.service.ts"
import { Injectable, OnApplicationBootstrap } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ProcessContext } from '@vendure/core';

@Injectable()
export class MyService implements OnApplicationBootstrap {
    constructor(private processContext: ProcessContext) {}

    onApplicationBootstrap() {
        if (this.processContext.isServer) {
            // code which will only execute when running in
            // the server process
        }
    }
}
```

## The job queue

Vendure uses a [job queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_queue) to handle the processing of certain tasks which are typically too slow to run in the
normal request-response cycle. A normal request-response looks like this:

![Regular request response](./Vendure_docs-job-queue.webp)

In the normal request-response, all intermediate tasks (looking up data in the database, performing business logic etc.)
occur before the response can be returned. For most operations this is fine, since those intermediate tasks are very fast.

Some operations however will need to perform much longer-running tasks. For example, updating the search index on
thousands of products could take up to a minute or more. In this case, we certainly don’t want to delay the response
until that processing has completed. That’s where a job queue comes in:

![Request response with job queue](./Vendure_docs-job-queue-2.webp)

### What does Vendure use the job queue for?

By default, Vendure uses the job queue for the following tasks:

- Re-building the search index
- Updating the search index when changes are made to Products, ProductVariants, Assets etc.
- Updating the contents of Collections
- Sending transactional emails

### How does the Job Queue work?

This diagram illustrates the job queue mechanism:

![Job queue sequence](./Vendure_docs-job-queue-3.webp)

The server adds jobs to the queue. The worker then picks up these jobs from the queue and processes them in sequence,
one by one (it is possible to increase job queue throughput by running multiple workers or by increasing the concurrency
of a single worker).

### JobQueueStrategy

The actual queue part is defined by the configured [`JobQueueStrategy`](/reference/typescript-api/job-queue/job-queue-strategy/).

If no strategy is defined, Vendure uses an [in-memory store](/reference/typescript-api/job-queue/in-memory-job-queue-strategy/)
of the contents of each queue. While this has the advantage
of requiring no external dependencies, it is not suitable for production because when the server is stopped, the entire
queue will be lost and any pending jobs will never be processed. Moreover, it cannot be used when running the worker
as a separate process.

A better alternative is to use the [DefaultJobQueuePlugin](/reference/typescript-api/job-queue/default-job-queue-plugin/)
(which will be used in a standard `@vendure/create` installation), which configures Vendure to use the [SqlJobQueueStrategy](/reference/typescript-api/job-queue/sql-job-queue-strategy).
This strategy uses the database as a queue, and means that even if the Vendure server stops, pending jobs will be persisted and upon re-start, they will be processed.

It is also possible to implement your own JobQueueStrategy to take advantage of other technologies.
Examples include RabbitMQ, Google Cloud Pub Sub & Amazon SQS. It may make sense to implement a custom strategy based on
one of these if the default database-based approach does not meet your performance requirements.

### Job Queue Performance

It is common for larger Vendure projects to define multiple custom job queues, When using the [DefaultJobQueuePlugin](/reference/typescript-api/job-queue/default-job-queue-plugin/)
with many queues, performance may be impacted. This is because the `SqlJobQueueStrategy` uses polling to check for
new jobs in the database. Each queue will (by default) query the database every 200ms. So if there are 10 queues,
this will result in a constant 50 queries/second.

In this case it is recommended to try the [BullMQJobQueuePlugin](/reference/typescript-api/core-plugins/job-queue-plugin/bull-mqjob-queue-plugin/),
which uses an efficient push-based strategy built on Redis.

### Using Job Queues in a plugin

If you create a [Vendure plugin](/guides/concepts/plugins/) which involves some long-running tasks, you can also make use of the job queue. See the [JobQueue plugin example](/TODO)
for a detailed annotated example.
