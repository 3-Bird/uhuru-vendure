title: Connect to the API
---

The first thing you'll need to do is to connect your storefront app to the **Shop API**. The Shop API is a GraphQL API
that provides access to the products, collections, customer data, and exposes mutations that allow you to add items to
the cart, checkout, manage customer accounts, and more.

:::tip
You can explore the Shop API by opening the GraphQL Playground in your browser at
[`http://localhost:3000/shop-api`](http://localhost:3000/shop-api) when your Vendure
server is running locally.

## Select a GraphQL client

GraphQL requests are made over HTTP, so you can use any HTTP client such as the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) to make requests to the Shop API. However, there are also a number of specialized GraphQL clients which can make working with GraphQL APIs easier. Here are some popular options:

* [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react): A full-featured client which includes a caching layer and React integration.
* [urql](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/): The highly customizable and versatile GraphQL client for React, Svelte, Vue, or plain JavaScript
* [graphql-request](https://github.com/jasonkuhrt/graphql-request): Minimal GraphQL client supporting Node and browsers for scripts or simple apps

Here are some examples of how to use these clients to connect to the Shop API.

### Fetch

First we'll look at a plain Fetch-based implementation, to show you that there's no special magic to a GraphQL request - it's just a POST request with a JSON body.

```ts
export function query(document: string, variables: Record<string, any> = {}) {
    return fetch('https://localhost:3000/shop-api', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          query: document,
          variables,
        }),
    })
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .catch((err) => console.log(err));
}
```
