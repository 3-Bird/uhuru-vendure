The heart of Vendure is its plugin system. Plugins not only allow you to instantly add new functionality to your
Vendure server via third-part npm packages, they are also the means by which you build out the custom business
logic of your application.

Plugins in Vendure allow one to:

- Modify the VendureConfig object, such as defining custom fields on existing entities.
- Extend the GraphQL APIs, including modifying existing types and adding completely new queries and mutations.
- Define new database entities and interact directly with the database.
- Interact with external systems that you need to integrate with.
- Respond to events such as new orders being placed.
- Trigger background tasks to run on the worker process.

â€¦ and more!

In a typical Vendure application, custom logic and functionality is implemented as a set of plugins
which are usually independent of one another. For example, there could be a plugin for each of the following:
wishlists, product reviews, loyalty points, gift cards, etc.
This allows for a clean separation of concerns and makes it easy to add or remove functionality as needed.

## Core Plugins

Vendure provides a set of core plugins covering common functionality such as assets handling,
email sending, and search. For documentation on these, see the [Core Plugins reference](/reference/typescript-api/core-plugins/).

## Plugin basics

Here's a bare-minimum example of a plugin:

```ts title="src/plugins/avatar-plugin/avatar.plugin.ts"
import { LanguageCode, PluginCommonModule, VendurePlugin } from '@vendure/core';

@VendurePlugin({
    imports: [PluginCommonModule],
    configure: config => {
        config.customFields.Customer.push({
            type: 'string',
            name: 'avatarUrl',
            label: [{ languageCode: LanguageCode.en, value: 'Avatar URL' }],
            list: true,
        });
        return config;
    },
})
export class AvatarPlugin {}
```

This plugin does one thing only: it adds a new custom field to the `Customer` entity.

The plugin is then imported into the `VendureConfig`:

```ts title="src/vendure-config.ts"
import { VendureConfig } from '@vendure/core';
import { AvatarPlugin } from './plugins/avatar-plugin/avatar.plugin';

export const config: VendureConfig = {
    // ...
    // highlight-next-line
    plugins: [AvatarPlugin],
};
```

The key feature is the `@VendurePlugin()` decorator, which marks the class as a Vendure plugin and accepts a configuration
object on the type [`VendurePluginMetadata`](/reference/typescript-api/plugin/vendure-plugin-metadata/).

A VendurePlugin is actually an enhanced version of a [NestJS Module](https://docs.nestjs.com/modules), and supports
all the metadata properties that NestJS modules support:

- `imports`: Allows importing other NestJS modules in order to make use of their exported providers.
- `providers`: The providers (services) that will be instantiated by the Nest injector and that may
    be shared across this plugin.
- `controllers`: Controllers allow the plugin to define REST-style endpoints.
- `exports`: The providers which will be exported from this plugin and made available to other plugins.

Additionally, the `VendurePlugin` decorator adds the following Vendure-specific properties:

- `configuration`: A function which can modify the `VendureConfig` object before the server bootstraps.
- `shopApiExtensions`: Allows the plugin to extend the GraphQL Shop API with new queries, mutations, resolvers & scalars.
- `adminApiExtensions`: Allows the plugin to extend the GraphQL Admin API with new queries, mutations, resolvers & scalars.
- `entities`: Allows the plugin to define new database entities.
- `compatibility`: Allows the plugin to declare which versions of Vendure it is compatible with.

:::info
Since a Vendure plugin is a superset of a NestJS module, this means that many NestJS modules are actually
valid Vendure plugins!
:::

## Plugin lifecycle

Since a VendurePlugin is built on top of the NestJS module system, any plugin (as well as any providers it defines)
can make use of any of the [NestJS lifecycle hooks](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/lifecycle-events):

- onModuleInit
- onApplicationBootstrap
- onModuleDestroy
- beforeApplicationShutdown
- onApplicationShutdown

:::caution
Note that lifecycle hooks are run in both the server and worker contexts.
If you have code that should only run either in the server context or worker context,
you can inject the [ProcessContext provider](/reference/typescript-api/common/process-context/).
